  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    isRequired: False
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. True if flag present.

  - name: --node-agent-sku-id
    isRequired: False
    summary: The SKU of the Batch node agent to be provisioned on compute nodes in the pool. The Batch node agent is a program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service. There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the 'List supported node agent SKUs' operation.

  description: 'When you request that a pool be deleted, the following actions occur: the pool state is set to deleting; any ongoing resize operation on the pool are stopped; the Batch service starts resizing the pool to zero nodes; any tasks running on existing nodes are terminated and requeued (as if a resize pool operation had been requested with the default requeue option); finally, the pool is removed from the system. Because running tasks are requeued, the user can rerun these tasks by updating their job to target a different pool. The tasks can then run on the new pool. If you want to override the requeue behavior, then you should call resize pool explicitly to shrink the pool to zero size before deleting the pool. If you call an Update, Patch or Delete API on a pool in the deleting state, it will fail with HTTP status code 409 with error code PoolBeingDeleted.'

  - name: --application-package-references
    isRequired: False
    summary: A list of application packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool. Changes to application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. If this element is present, it replaces any existing application package references. If you specify an empty collection, then all application package references are removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing application package references are left unchanged. Space separated application IDs with optional version in 'id[#version]' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --certificate-references
    isRequired: False
    summary: A list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool. If omitted, any existing certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory. Space separated certificate thumbprints.

  - name: --metadata
    isRequired: False
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the pool as metadata. If this element is present, it replaces any existing metadata configured on the pool. If you specify an empty collection, any metadata is removed from the pool. If omitted, any existing metadata is left unchanged. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-command-line
    isRequired: False
    summary: The command line of the start task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.

  - name: --start-task-environment-settings

    summary: A list of environment variable settings for the start task. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-max-task-retry-count
    isRequired: False
    summary: The maximum number of times the task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-resource-files
    isRequired: False
    summary: A list of files that the Batch service will download to the compute node before running the command line. Space separated resource references in filename=blobsource format.
    description: ''
  - name: --start-task-wait-for-success
    isRequired: False
    summary: Whether the Batch service should wait for the start task to complete successfully (that is, to exit with exit code 0) before scheduling any tasks on the compute node. If true and the start task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false, the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case, other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false. Specify either 'true' or 'false' to update the property.
